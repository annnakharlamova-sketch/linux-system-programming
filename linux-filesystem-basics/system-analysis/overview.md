# System Analysis

This section contains practical analysis of Linux system directories and virtual filesystems.

## Covered Areas

- `/var/log`: log files analysis, file size inspection, recent changes, error search
- `/etc`: configuration files inspection
- `/proc`: extracting CPU and memory information
- `/bin` vs `/usr/bin`: comparison of executable files

The analysis was performed using standard command-line utilities such as `ls`, `du`, `grep`, `find`, and `comm`.
